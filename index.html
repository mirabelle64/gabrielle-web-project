<h1>Help, I broke the internet!</h1>

<p>Hello world. My name is Gabrielle, and I have no idea what I'm doing ...
</p>

<p>I'm also trying to learn how to use GitHub. Wish me luck ...</p>

<h2>A bit about me</h2>

<p>Things which I enjoy include the following:
  <ul>
        <li>Thai food</li>
        <li>Rock music</li>
        <li>Terrible puns</li>
  </ul>

<p>My dream is to open an ice cream parlour with my best friend (we're not bothered where, just so long as it's warm).<p/>

  <p><strong>Potential names:</strong><p/>
    <ol>
        <li>Picky eater (lemon and mint sorbet)</li>
        <li>Mangonite</li>
        <li>Appleations</li>
        <li>I've got the blue(berries)</li>
        <li>The last straw(berry)</li>
    </ol>
